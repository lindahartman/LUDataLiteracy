## Challenges

:::{.callout-note}
These challenges focus on using Quarto[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html) to style the report and prepare it for publication.

Pick one of the notebooks you created during the practical session and iteratively apply the features demonstrated in the videos from the last module.
:::


:::{.challenge}
| Add front matter to your notebook. Specify the title, subtitle, author information, and an automatically updated date.
:::

:::{.challenge}
| Enhance the narrative in your markdown cells. Use section headers, bullet point lists, bold, and italic text to highlight key points.
| :bulb: Tip: You can also [write equations](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/jupyter.html#equations) in markdown cells. Quarto renders them in a clean, professional math font.
:::

:::{.challenge}
| Label the cells that generate plotnine figures. Add figure captions and reference these figures in the markdown below the images.
| :bulb: Check out [these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/computations/jupyter.html#multiple-figures) for placing two figures side by side, including subcaptions and layout options.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
These colored blocks are called callouts. You can add them to your report—see instructions [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/jupyter.html#callouts).
:::

:::{.challenge}
Render your report in multiple formats: HTML, DOCX, and PDF (see the TinyTeX installation video for guidance). Create a README file with instructions on how to run your analysis report.
